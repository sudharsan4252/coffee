    <p style="width:50%">House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and every drinker. That is what makes them so unique
    and so special. The blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference of the roaster and/or distributor.
    For example, Starbucks describes their House Blend as “the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. The
    one blend that set the course for the way our master blenders and roasters work even today. A true reflection of us and
    delicious cup of coffee, period.”
    
    Brewing coffee is also an important factor in how the flavors and aromas are represented in the cup. Preference depends
    on the consumer of the final cup, but there are clear benefits to different brewing styles.
    
    For House Blend coffee, it has been said to taste best when it has been brewed through a Chemex machine. This machine
    will bring out the smooth texture and purer flavor of the blend. A Chemex is a “slow-and-steady” approach to coffee
    brewing, similar to a drip machine, but with a filter that is 3 times as thick. The machine keeps the water that is
    pouring over the beans at an ideal 190 degrees, draws out any excess oil residue on the bean, and provides the smoothest
    and purest taste of these unique blends.
    
    Coffee can be seen as an art form in itself. From the temperature of the water to the flavors within the bean, making a
    decent cup of coffee is not as easy as it seems. House Blends are unique based on the time and energy spent harvesting,
    roasting, tasting and re-tasting to create a unique blend that ends up in your cup.</p>

        <p style="width:50%">Simply put, “French roast” describes the color of the coffee beans after they have been roasted. These beans are on the
        darker end of the scale, and are usually the color of dark chocolate. It does not mean the coffee was grown or roasted
        in France (although yes, that is where the roasting style originated in the 1800s).
        
        French Roast Coffee Beans
        The name is believed to reflect the tastes and traditions of coffee roasters in Europe in the 19th century, where
        dark-roasted coffee was all the rage. Italian roast, or espresso roast, was nearly as dark as French, and Vienna roast-
        a staple of the Viennese cafes and pastry shops known for their great coffee - was slightly lighter than Italian roast.
        But the French proudly took the honors as the darkest roast of all. Here's a more detailed article that tackles the
        differences between French roast vs Italian roast.
        
        Many different kinds of beans can be roasted to the French roast level, and they do not need to originate from any
        specific region to qualify. French roast coffee can be made from Central American, African, or Indonesian beans.
        Essentially, beans grown anywhere in the world can be used to make French roast.</p>

                    <p style="width:50%">Colombia is well known for being the best place to grow coffee beans. Colombia’s coffee beans are often regarded as the
                    mildest, most well-balanced beans. Colombia is the third-highest producer of coffee in the world. Since Colombian coffee
                    is prized for its flavor and reputation, coffee sellers often label coffees that do not come from Colombia as Colombian
                    coffee.
                    
                    The highest quality Colombian coffee is called Colombian supremo. Colombian supremo has a sweet smell and tastes a bit
                    like caramel. Colombian supremo usually has about 95 milligrams of caffeine per cup of coffee.
                    
                    Colombia is the world’s largest producer of arabica coffee. Whether it comes from Colombia or not, Arabica coffee is
                    almost always labeled as Colombian coffee, so you should always check any arabica coffees’ origin to make sure that they
                    are actually from Colombia. Arabica coffees usually have between 70 to 180 milligrams of caffeine per cup.
                    
                    When you are buying Colombian coffee, it is essential to look for fair trade or rainforest alliance coffees from
                    Colombia. Java Planet’s Single-Origin Columbian Coffee is an excellent single-sourced coffee that actually comes from
                    Colombia.
                    
                    With the overharvesting of rainforests in Colombia, it is crucial to help Colombian farmers keep their sustainable and
                    ethical businesses open. Many coffee farms in Colombia also use pesticides and other toxic chemicals to grow their
                    coffee, which is not good for the environment or your body.
                    
                    Buying quality Colombian coffee will support farmers who protect the Colombian rainforests and pay their living wage,
                    and you will know that your coffee is healthy and safe.</p>

                                <p3> Winter was just around the corner. It was my first time in the biggest coffee shop in town. I could see the cheerful and
                                brilliant lighting of the shop as I walked across the vast parking lot. There were tables outside the shop each with a
                                brown vintage style umbrella. This particular coffee shop is not a cafe, it’s a coffee shop literally. They sell the
                                finest coffee from all over the world. It also has a book corner in the left hand side of the shop where we can buy
                                books. They make very good coffee as well. This place is an ideal place for students and employees to release stress. As
                                I made my way through the transparent glass door, a blanket of warm air hit me and the rich aroma of coffee which was
                                delectable. The noise the customers made was immense which reminded me how popular a place this is.
                                
                                I made my way to the coffee bar at the end of the shop made of reclaimed wood. A barista stood before me. He welcomed me
                                with a charming smile. I got my cup of Americano and paid for it in the next counter. The aged wooden floor creaked
                                beneath me as I was walking towards my table. I made myself comfortable on a bulky wooden chair</p3>
